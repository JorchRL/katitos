## How I worked on this

I followed a tutorial by LamaDev, on Youtube, for this. As I learned how to use React and Sass by building this page.

## What did I learn?

(1) Mainly I learned the basics of React and Sass
(2) I learned basic techniques for animations

## If I had more time...

I would rebuild everything from scratch and have it served as a static page. With Next.js
